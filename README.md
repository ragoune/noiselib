# noiselib
An implementation of libnoise in Go

# Goals
The goal of this library is to provide a complete reimplementation of http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/ in Go. It should be functionally equivilent, and provide very similar outputs as compared to the original.

# Progress
All noise sources have been implemented, as well as the noise utils, for easier access to terrain style output, as well as following the tutorials in the original site. Bugfixes are to come.
